- Libraries that need to be downloaded for the project to work:
librosa, numpy, pandas, pathlib, scipy, sklearn, tqdm, matplotlib, Ipython, statsmodels, ipynb

- In order for the codes to work, the dataset must be put in the folder with the code files, with the name "data_gtzan".

- Excel files where separate operations are performed on the files, and for later use after feature extraction
because it is formed and excel files for later use after feature extraction because it occurs, file "feature_extraction" must be run first.
